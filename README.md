#  JavaScript Quiz App

Day 3 of my 30 Days JavaScript Challenge.

An interactive quiz application built using Vanilla JavaScript that tests users with multiple-choice questions, tracks scores, and displays results.

## Features

- 📋 Multiple-choice questions
- 👉 Next question navigation
- 🎯 Score tracking
- ✅ Highlight correct and incorrect answers
- 🏁 Final result screen
- 🔄 Restart quiz functionality
- 📱 Fully responsive design


## Architecture Approach

The application uses a **state-driven approach.
Quiz data is stored as an array of objects:

```js
[
  {
    question: "What is JavaScript?",
    options: ["Language", "Library", "Framework", "Database"],
    answer: 0
  }
]
```

## Application state includes:

Current question index
Selected answer
Score
The UI updates dynamically based on state changes.

## Tech Stack
